<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Using Call Target</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">When you're in a group, use /calltarget to put a icon on the target's head. Everyone must have the addon if they want to see the marker. Use /calltarget again on the same target or with no target selected to remove the marker. You can also use /calltarget 2, to set a marker with different color. </span></p>
